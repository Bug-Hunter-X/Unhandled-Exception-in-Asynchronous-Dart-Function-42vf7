# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Function

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in Dart asynchronous programming:  improper exception handling that leads to silent failures.  The `bug.dart` file contains code with the flawed exception handling.  The solution (`bugSolution.dart`) shows how to correctly handle exceptions to prevent such failures.

## The Problem

The original code uses a `try-catch` block in the asynchronous `fetchData` function. However, the `catch` block rethrows the exception using `rethrow`. If there's no further error handling, the exception will go unhandled, potentially leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior. This can be especially problematic in production environments.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file presents a more robust solution.  The `catch` block now includes specific error handling, logging the error, and possibly implementing alternative actions like retry logic or displaying an informative message to the user.  The top-level `main` function is crucial here to handle the exception that has been re-thrown from the `fetchData` function.
